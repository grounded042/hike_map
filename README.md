# hike_map
Map your hiking adventures for all to see.

This little React app will load data from different hiking trips and display it with a minimal interface. Originally designed to map each day of my PCT through-hike in 2018.

## getting started
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- navigate to [http://localhost:5672/](http://localhost:5672/) to see an example from a trip I took to Zion National Park.
